# Cell calling. 

# Cell barcodes that were associated with real cell transcriptomes were identified using emptyDrops45, 
# which assesses whether the RNA content associated with a cell barcode is significantly distinct from the ambient background RNA pres- ent within each sample. 
# A minimum unique molecular identifier (UMI) threshold was set at 5,000, and cells with P < 0.01 (Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg-corrected) were considered for further analysis. 
# The ambient RNA profile was determined from barcodes associated with fewer than 100 UMIs for the atlas
